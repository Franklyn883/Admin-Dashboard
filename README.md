# Admin-Dashboard
Web-based application designed to provide an interface to showcase all i've learnt so far in css and html. This project focus on using grid and flexbox fo the layout of the page. It was a little bit difficult though, making everything fit in the proper place. In this project i get to know more about using rem and em relative units. The padding was doing weird stuff when i used em, then i learnt that, em on padding takes their initial value from the font size.
